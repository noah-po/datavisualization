\abstract{The salaries of university employees vary significantly based on the following: experience, university size, and department. In particular, there are vast differences in salaries among faculty members and employees across departments, with professors in mathematical and business-related fields paid higher than their counterparts in humanities and fine arts, on average. Using a data file containing over 13,000 observations (each corresponding to a salaried instructor or staff member) from the University of Nebraska payroll from the 2021-2022 fiscal year, this poster contains salary relationships across departments, positions (assistant professor, associate professor, full professor), and universities. Through the use of exploratory data analysis, we seek to gain a more thorough understanding of professorial salaries within the University of Nebraska system.}
